# SpriteKit Shaders &amp; Geometry Demo

This demo app shows how **SKShader** and **SKWarpable** can be used to create a liquid effect for a simple 2D pool simulation. Particles from **SKEmitterNode** and falling leaves animated with SKAction are thrown in for fun. The purpose of this code is to provide an introduction to how fragment shaders can be easily used with SpriteKit.
